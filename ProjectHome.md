# Open Developer Kit for Semantic Annotation #

SemLinker is a Java library designed to experiment various applications of text mining and
annotations. Using an external annotator (currently www.wikimeta.com), SemLinker can apply
various annotation layers and information extraction processes on a text document. It can also provide and apply to documents various NLP methods (text normalization, NER, Coreference detection , Mutual disambiguation).

SemLinker is divided in two main components:

1. the Semkit component to experiment semantic annotation

2. the KBP component to reproduce KBP entity Linking experiment
